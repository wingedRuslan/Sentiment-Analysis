    "- Word2vec, published by Google in 2013, is a neural network implementation that learns distributed representations for words. \n",
    "- Other deep or recurrent neural network architectures had been proposed for learning word representations prior to this, but the major problem with these was the long time required to train the models. Word2vec learns quickly relative to other models.\n",
